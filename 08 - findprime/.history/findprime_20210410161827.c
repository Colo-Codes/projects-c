 * Requirements: create a program to print all prime numbers from 3 to 100.
 *      There will be no input.
 *      The output should be each prime number separated by a space on a single line.
 *      Use an array to store prime numbers.
 *      You can hard-code the first two prime numbers (2 and 3) on the array.
 *      Use loops.
 * Hints:
 *      Criteria to find a prime number:
 *          A number is considered prime if it is not evenly divisible by any other previous prime number.
 *          A test to ensure that a number n is prime, is to check n >= i * i, where i is a previous number.
 *          Even numbers after 2 are not prime.
